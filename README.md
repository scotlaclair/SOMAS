3. **After retry 3**: Human notified for intervention

### Bounded Autonomy

SOMAS operates autonomously with clear boundaries:

- ✅ **Autonomous**: All 6 stages (Ideation → Validation)
- ⏸️ **Human Gate**: Only at Staging (final merge approval)
- 🚨 **Human Escalation**: Only when max retries exhausted

### Progress Notifications

Pipeline progress is reported via:

- Issue comments with stage completion status

4. 🗺️ **Updates Roadmap** (`.somas/roadmap.md`) with "Future Enhancement" items

**Note:** For architectural decisions, use the manual process to create ADRs in `.somas/architecture/ADRs/` following the guidelines in the ADR README.

### Benefits

- **Preserves Knowledge**: High-value insights preserved beyond PR comments
- **Enables Follow-up**: Recommendations become actionable issues
- **Improves Traceability**: Links back to source PR and context
- **Supports Planning**: Roadmap reflects actual feedback and evolution
