SOMAS: Self-Sovereign Orchestrated Multi-Agent SystemAether-Powered Autonomous Software DevelopmentSOMAS is a "Process-as-Code" software development lifecycle (SDLC) engine. Unlike traditional CI/CD which automates deployment, SOMAS automates development.It utilizes 20 Specialized Autonomous Agents governed by the 11-State Aether Lifecycle to transform raw intent (issues) into production-ready code.🏗 Architecture: The Aether LifecycleSOMAS does not run linearly. It operates as a deterministic state machine. Each state acts as a Gate that must be satisfied by specific agents before the artifact promotes to the next stage.The 11-State MachineStatePhaseResponsible AgentsFunction01INTAKETriage, AdvisorIngests issues, determines feasibility, and routes request type.02SPECIFYSpecifier, RequirementsConverts vague intent into strict functional specifications (PRD).03PLANPlanner, ArchitectArchitect designs system structure; Planner builds the task graph.04DECOMPOSEDecomposerBreaks architecture into atomic implementation tasks ($\le$ 4hrs).05IMPLEMENTImplementer, CopilotGenerates actual code, tests, and config based on decomposed tasks.06VERIFYTester, DebuggerRuns test suites.

Manages state transitions and context passing.Advisor: Provides strategic guidance and feasibility analysis.Architect: Defines high-level system design, patterns, and file structures.Planner: Creates execution schedules and dependency graphs.Security: Enforces security policies and vulnerability scanning.Execution & EngineeringImplementer: The primary coder. Writes file content based on specs.Copilot: Assists Implementer with snippets, refactoring, and completions.Decomposer: Breaks complex requirements into atomic coding tasks.Debugger: Analyzes stack traces and iteratively patches code.Merger: Handles git operations, branching, and conflict resolution.Quality & VerificationTester: Executes unit and integration test runners.Validator: Verifies system state against the original Requirements.Reviewer: Performs static analysis and code style reviews (human-proxy).Specifier: Writes detailed technical specifications.Requirements: Extracts and manages functional requirements.Operations & MaintenanceTriage: First responder to new issues/requests.Deployer: Manages build artifacts and publication.Operator: Ensures system stability after deployment.Analyzer: Computes metrics and identifies process bottlenecks.Documenter: Maintains knowledge base and updates READMEs.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.9+GitOpenAI API Key (or compatible LLM provider)Installation# Clone the repository

Running the PipelineYou can trigger the autonomous pipeline manually or via GitHub Issues.CLI Mode:# Run the autonomous pipeline for a specific issue
python -m somas.core.runner --issue_number 123
GitHub Mode:Simply apply the label somas:change to any Issue. The GitHub Action will trigger the Intake stage automatically.📊 Governance & SecuritySOMAS is designed to be Self-Sovereign. It operates on its own dev branch and creates Pull Requests.No Direct Push: Agents cannot push directly to main.Human-in-the-Loop: Critical gates (like Release) require human approval on the PR.Sandboxing: All agent code execution is sandboxed (Docker support coming soon).📄 DocumentationAlignment StrategyAgent DefinitionsStage Configuration🤝 ContributingPlease read CONTRIBUTING.md for details on our code of conduct and the process for submitting pull requests.📜 LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.
