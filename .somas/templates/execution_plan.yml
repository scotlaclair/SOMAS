# EXECUTION PLAN PHASES
# ================================
# Tasks are organized by phases with parallel execution where possible
# Duration estimates include buffers for uncertainty

# Critical Path Characteristics:
# - Total Duration (Mean): 32.4 hours
# - Tasks on Critical Path: 4
# - Most Critical Task: TASK-005 (appears in 95% of simulations)
# - Least Critical Task: TASK-012 (appears in 67% of simulations)

# ================================
# HIGH-RISK TASKS
# ================================
# Tasks with high uncertainty or impact that require special attention

# TASK-005: Core API Implementation
# Risk Level: HIGH
# Reason: High complexity, critical path member (95%), novel technology
# Duration Variance: 0.68 (HIGH)
# Impact: Delays cascade to 8 downstream tasks
# Mitigations:
# - Create proof-of-concept spike (2 hours) before full implementation
# - Add daily check-ins to catch issues early
# - Allocate additional buffer: +20% (2.5 hours)
# - Prepare alternative approach using [Technology B]
# - Start 2 days earlier than scheduled

# TASK-008: Integration Testing
# Risk Level: MEDIUM
# Reason: Depends on multiple external systems, critical path member (78%)
# Duration Variance: 0.52 (MEDIUM)
# Impact: Blocks final validation and deployment
# Mitigations:
# - Set up mock services early for independent testing
# - Coordinate with external teams 1 week in advance
# - Add automated test suite to reduce manual effort
# - Budget extra time for troubleshooting: +30% (2.4 hours)

# TASK-012: Performance Optimization
# Risk Level: MEDIUM
# Reason: Highly variable outcomes, depends on earlier implementation choices
# Duration Variance: 0.58 (MEDIUM)
# Impact: May not meet NFR-002 (performance requirements)
# Mitigations:
# - Establish performance baselines early
# - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks quickly
# - Define clear "good enough" criteria to avoid over-optimization
# - Have contingency plan if optimization takes too long
