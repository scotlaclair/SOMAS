  ## SIMULATION PROTOCOL
  
  ### 1. BUILD TASK GRAPH
  From the specification, create a directed acyclic graph (DAG):
  - Nodes = Tasks (extracted from requirements, user stories, components)
  - Edges = Dependencies (logical prerequisites, data dependencies)
  - Weights = Estimated duration (with uncertainty range)
  
  **Task Identification:**
  - Parse all requirements (REQ-F-XXX, REQ-NF-XXX)
  - Extract components from architecture
  - Identify implementation tasks from user stories
  - Group related tasks into logical units
  
  **Dependency Analysis:**
  - Data dependencies (Task B needs output of Task A)
  - Logical dependencies (Task B must follow Task A)
  - Resource dependencies (shared infrastructure)
  - Integration dependencies (API contracts must exist before consumers)
  
  ### 2. ESTIMATE DURATIONS
  For each task, estimate:
  - **Optimistic time** (10th percentile): Best case, no issues
  - **Most likely time** (50th percentile): Expected typical case
  - **Pessimistic time** (90th percentile): With complications
  
  **Estimation Approach:**
  1. Check historical data in `.somas/analytics/` if available
  2. Use task complexity indicators:
     - Lines of code to write/modify
     - Number of integrations
     - Novelty (new vs. familiar tech)
     - Testing complexity
  3. Apply multipliers for risk factors (configured in .somas/config.yml under optimization.risk_multipliers):
     - External dependencies
     - New technology
     - High complexity
     - Integration heavy
  
  **Duration Distribution:**
  Use PERT (Beta) distribution: Mean = (Optimistic + 4*MostLikely + Pessimistic) / 6
  
  ### 3. RUN MONTE CARLO SIMULATION
  For N = 1000 iterations:
    1. Sample duration for each task from its distribution
    2. Calculate earliest start time for each task (considering dependencies)
    3. Calculate project completion time (max finish time)
    4. Record critical path for this iteration
    5. Record result
  
  **Analysis:**
  - Mean completion time
  - Median completion time
  - P90 completion time (90th percentile)
  - Standard deviation
  - Critical path frequency (which tasks appear most often)
  - Task slack time (float) distribution
  
  ### 4. IDENTIFY PARALLELIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
  Find tasks with:
  - No mutual dependencies (can run simultaneously)
  - Similar durations (load balancing)
  - Non-overlapping resource needs
  
  **Parallel Groups:**
  Group tasks into phases where all tasks in a phase can run in parallel:
  - Phase 1: Tasks with no dependencies
  - Phase 2: Tasks depending only on Phase 1
  - Phase N: Tasks depending only on Phases 1..N-1
  
  **Concurrency Analysis:**
  - Optimal team size for parallelization
  - Resource contention points
  - Synchronization requirements
  
  ### 5. OPTIMIZE TASK SIZING
  For each task:
  - If variance > threshold: High uncertainty, consider decomposition
  - If duration > 8 hours: Too large, recommend splitting
  - If duration < 1 hour: Consider bundling with related tasks
  
  **Decomposition Strategy:**
  - Split by feature boundary
  - Split by layer (frontend, backend, database)
  - Split by risk (separate risky parts for early validation)
  
  ### 6. IDENTIFY HIGH-RISK TASKS
  Flag tasks with:
  - High duration variance (uncertain estimates)
  - Critical path membership > 70% of simulations
  - Multiple complex dependencies
  - Novel technology or approaches
  
  **Risk Mitigations:**
  - Early prototyping for high-risk tasks
  - Additional buffer time
  - Frequent checkpoints
  - Alternative approaches documented
  
  ### 7. OUTPUT OPTIMAL SEQUENCE
  Produce execution plan with:
  - Total project duration (mean, P90)
  - Critical path tasks (ordered)
  - Parallel execution phases
  - Task assignments (if team size known)
  - Risk factors and mitigations
  - Recommendations for optimization
