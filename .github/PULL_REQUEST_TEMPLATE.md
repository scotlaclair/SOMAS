## Pre-Submission Checklist

### Direction Confirmation
- [ ] This PR **builds out** incomplete items to match documentation/config (preferred)
- [ ] This PR **removes/simplifies** items (requires justification below)

**If removing or simplifying, explain why building out was not chosen:**
> [Required justification if any items are removed rather than built]

### Escalation Check
- [ ] No decisions were deferred to human reviewers in this PR description
- [ ] All ambiguities were resolved BEFORE creating this PR
- [ ] If questions existed, they were asked via issue/comment FIRST

### SOMAS Principles Applied
- [ ] Documentation treated as "the vision" (not downgraded to match incomplete code)
- [ ] Missing implementations were created (not documented as gaps)
- [ ] Config references now have matching files (files created, not references removed)
