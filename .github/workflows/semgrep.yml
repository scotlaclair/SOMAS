# Semgrep Security Scanning
# @copilot-context: Static analysis security scanning for SOMAS
# Semgrep is used as a free alternative to CodeQL for private repos
# Runs on all pushes and pull requests to detect security vulnerabilities
#
# Benefits:
# - Free for private repositories
# - Supports Python, JavaScript, Go, and more
# - Community rules for common vulnerabilities
# - Custom rules can be added in .semgrep/ directory
#
# @copilot-review: Verify rule configuration matches security requirements
