SOMAS - Self-Sovereign Orchestrated Multi-Agent System.

An AI-first Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that transforms project ideas
into production-ready software through orchestrated AI agents powered by 2026
Frontier Tier models.

SOMAS operates through an 11-stage neurology-inspired autonomous pipeline:

1. SIGNAL (Intake) - Catch the initial request
2. DESIGN (Specify) - Expand into requirements
3. GRID (Plan) - Map components & strategy
4. LINE (Decompose) - Break into atomic tasks
5. MCP (Implement) - Generate code via AI agents
6. PULSE (Verify) - Run tests, check heartbeat
7. SYNAPSE (Integrate) - Connect & merge
8. OVERLOAD (Harden) - Stress test & document
9. VELOCITY (Release) - Deploy at speed
10. VIBE (Operate) - Monitor SLOs
11. WHOLE (Learn) - Analyze & loop back

Modules:
    core: Core orchestration functionality (runner, state management, feedback loops)
    agents: AI agent implementations and utilities
    analytics: Metrics tracking and POC analysis
    apo: Autonomous Prompt Optimization framework

Example:
    Basic usage::

        import somas
        print(f"SOMAS version: {somas.__version__}")
